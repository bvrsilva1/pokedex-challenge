/*

I've tried to implement my own fizzy search but it was not robust enough. I check the intersection 
of the both string sets, if this intersection has a considerable number of characters (0.7 in a scale from 0 to 1), 
then there is a match. 
After browsing about fuzzy search, I've found fuse.js, a lightweight library with zero dependencies. It has 11.1k stars 
on GitHub and its size is only 28.3kb. The library is well documented, has been used for for more than 5k developrs. 
It has been maintained by 64 contributors in total and the last commit was 24 days ago. The library has been tested 
and has no major issues.

It would be a good discussion with the dev team to decide if we are going to use this library in production, what 
are the best parameters for our fuzzy search and to make sure we do not reinvet the wheel.
